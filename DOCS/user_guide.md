# User Guide: Understanding the New Script Documentation

Welcome to the newly documented Bash utility scripts! This guide will help you understand the comment blocks that have been added to each script, making them easier to use and maintain.

## Overview

Every script in the `output/` directory has been enhanced with two types of standardized comment blocks:
1.  **File Header**: A block at the very top of each script that describes the file's overall purpose.
2.  **Function Header**: A block just before each function that details what that specific function does.

The information in these blocks is automatically generated by analyzing the script's code, ensuring the documentation is accurate and reflects the script's actual behavior.

---

## 1. The File Header

Every script begins with a header that provides a high-level summary.

### File Header Format

```bash
# ##############################################################################
# Author:       jmrenouard/jean-Marie Renouard
# Email:        jmrenouard@lightpath.fr
#
# Description:
#   [A clear, concise description of the script's overall purpose.]
#
# Usage:
#   bash <script_name.sh> [argument1] [argument2]
#
# Examples:
#   # Example 1: [Explain what this example does.]
#   bash <script_name.sh> example_arg1
#
#   # Example 2: [Explain this more complex example.]
#   bash <script_name.sh> example_arg1 example_arg2
# ##############################################################################
```

### Reading the File Header

-   **Description**: This section gives you a quick summary of what the script is for. For example, it might say "A collection of utility functions for managing MongoDB" or "A script to handle LVM operations."

-   **Usage**: This shows you how the script is intended to be used.
    -   `source utils.sh`: This means the script is a library of functions. You should load it into your shell session using the `source` command before you can use its functions.
    -   `bash my_script.sh [args]`: This means the script is meant to be executed directly from the command line.

-   **Examples**: This section provides one or more practical examples of how to use the script, helping you get started quickly.

## 2. The Function Header

Directly above each function, you will find a detailed comment block explaining its specific role.

### Function Header Format

```bash
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
#   [Detailed description of what the function does and its purpose.]
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - [Name or description of the first argument.]
#   $2 - [Name or description of the second argument.]
#   ... (add as many as needed)
#
# Outputs:
#   - Writes [description of output] to stdout.
#   - Returns 0 on success, 1 on failure (or describe other return codes).
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Reading the Function Header

-   **Description**: This tells you what the function does in detail. It might include the main action, the purpose, and any important behaviors.

-   **Arguments**: This is a critical section that explains what inputs the function expects.
    -   Each argument is listed by its position (`$1`, `$2`, `$*`).
    -   The description explains the purpose of the argument (e.g., "The database name," "The output file path").
    -   If an argument is optional, it will be noted, along with its default value. For example: `$1 - (Optional) The timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30.`

-   **Outputs**: This section describes what happens when you run the function. It's not just about what you see on the screen.
    -   **stdout**: Describes any text or data the function prints to the standard output.
    -   **stderr**: Describes any error or warning messages printed to the standard error stream.
    -   **Return Codes**: Explains the meaning of the function's exit code (e.g., `0` for success, `1` for failure).
    -   **File System Changes**: Details if the function creates, modifies, or deletes any files or directories.
    -   **Environment Variables**: Notes if the function `exports` or changes any environment variables.

By using these clear and consistent comment blocks, you can now understand the functionality of any script or function at a glance, without having to decipher the underlying code.
